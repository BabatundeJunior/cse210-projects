/*
    Eternal Quest - Goal Tracker
    ============================
    This program exceeds the core requirements in the following ways:

    Improved User Experience
    Clear and user-friendly menu system.
    Input validation to prevent errors.
    Goals display formatted status indicators ([âœ“] for completed, [ ] for incomplete).

    Persistent Data with File I/O
    Goals, progress, and scores are saved and loaded from a file.
    The program restores user progress on relaunch.

    Advanced Goal Logic and Gamification
    Checklist goals track progress and award points incrementally.
    A bonus is granted when a checklist goal is fully completed.
    Eternal goals cannot be marked complete, aligning with their purpose.

    Organized and Scalable Code
    Methods are structured for easy modifications.
    New goal types can be added with minimal changes.

    Strong Object-Oriented Design
    Encapsulation: All member variables are private or protected.
    Inheritance: All goal types inherit from the base Goal class.
    Polymorphism: Key methods are properly overridden.



    This implementation improves usability, persistence, and scalability, making it a more maintainable system.
